  <description>Adds a maintenance need for buildings with components. Only when not properly maintained will breakdowns happen.

Important
====
REQUIRES CCL

Does not require a new save game

Features
====
Buildings using components will now gradually deteriorate. The odds of a breakdown happening (and requiring replacement components), is directly linked to the amount of deterioration. 

To keep your machinery in top shape, your colonists with the repair work enabled will periodically maintain components. As long as components are properly maintained, they cannot randomly break down.
