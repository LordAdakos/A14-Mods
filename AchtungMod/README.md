# RimWorld-Achtung-Mod v1.11
Command your colonists like a boss!

With your colonists selected, use right-click and drag to distribute all selected colonists along a line. They get drafted automatically. 10 colonists + 10 doors in a row? No problem!

How to:

1) Install Community Core Library (from Steam or via https://github.com/RimWorldCCLTeam/CommunityCoreLibrary)

2) Select at least one colonist

3) Achtung! will not activate with a single colonist. Override this with the alt-key.

4) Use the right mouse button to drag along the map to distribute selected colonists

5) Colonists that are not drafted become automatically drafted. Hold shift-key to not auto-draft.

6) Right-clicking on a target now display a menu containing the actions of all selected colonists. Never again order all colonists separately to melee a person!

7) Right-clicking in a room with a non-drafted colonist selected will present a menu with two (possible) choices: “Clean Room” and “Roof Room”.

# FAQ

**Does this mod alter my save files?**

Answer: No, this mod changes only the interface and the user actions. Rimworld will warn you but you can simply ignore the warning. If you later decide to remove Achtung! your saved games will still work as before!

**Is this mod compatible with other mods?**

Answer: Most likely. I don’t know of any mods altering the selection mechanism. The combat menu is created in a general way so it will include actions from other mods without breaking.

**I think this should work different/better. Are you open for changes or improvement requests?**

Answer: Always! Please submit an Issue via GitHub or send me an email to **andreas@pardeike.net**

Have fun!
