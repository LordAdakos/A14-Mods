    <description>Achtung! Mod v1.11 for RimWorld

I want to share my first mod with you. It's a drafting helper that enables the right mouse button for dragging to mark drafting destinations and room commands. Instead of a single horde of colonists around the place you right click it is now possible to drag any line along the colonists will be distributed. Very useful for door combat handling.

With your colonists selected, use right-click and drag to distribute all selected colonists along a line. They get drafted automatically. 10 colonists + 10 doors in a row? No problem!

Community Core Library is currently required.

How to:

1) Install Community Core Library from Steam and put this Achtung! Mod after it.

2) Select at least one colonist (no need to draft them)

3) Per default, Achtung! won't activate with a single colonist selected. Override this with the alt-key (not necessary if you click inside a room).

4) Use the right mouse button to drag along the map to distribute selected colonists or click inside a room to get the room commands.

5) Colonists that are not drafted become automatically drafted. Hold shift-key to not auto-draft.

6) Common actions: Right-clicking on a target now display a menu containing the actions of all selected colonists. Never again order all colonists separately to melee a person!

7) Room menu: Right-clicking in a room with a non-drafted colonist selected will present a menu with two (possible) choices: “Clean Room” and “Roof Room”.

FAQ

Does this mod alter my save files?
Answer: No, this mod changes only the interface and the user actions. Rimworld will warn you but you can simply ignore the warning. If you later decide to remove Achtung! your saved games will still work as before!

Is this mod compatible with other mods?
Answer: Most likely. I don’t know of any mods altering the selection mechanism. The combat menu is created in a general way so it will include actions from other mods without breaking.

Why is this called "Achtung!"
Answer: It's german for "Attention!" and used in the military as a command.

I think this should work different/better. Are you open for changes or improvement requests?
Answer: Always! Please submit an Issue via GitHub or send me an email to andreas@pardeike.net
