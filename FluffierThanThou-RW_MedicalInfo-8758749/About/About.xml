Adds a comprehensive medical overview tab, showing your colonists' health at a glance.
- Medical care designation

Notes
====
Detecting which diseases/wounds/etc affect a certain body function is not as easy as one might expect it to be. There may be some inconsistencies in the labels associated with efficiency scores. If you encounter any, please leave a report so I can try and fix them.
